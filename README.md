This is a Christmas Santa Animation project.

#HTML
I used the heading tag for the Santa says hi in html section while I used Javascript to create the span and append it to the body dynamically.

#css
I used @keyframes to animate the element a few seconds linear.

#JavaScript
I added eventlistener mousemove to listen for the movement of the mouse on the body with the xpos and ypos set to offsetx and offsety of the event handler.
I also used setTimeout property to remove the span after 2secs.

Yeah cool project to build. Love it.
